Project Code Examples for "Intermediate Django"
===============================================

This repository hosts the source code for the
"Intermediate Django - Building Modern, Scalable, and Maintainable Web Applications"
video tutorial series published by O'Reilly Media. The videos themselves
are available for purchase here: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920040903.do

The series walks you through building a web application using Python 3.4 and Django 1.8.
It also includes integrating Celery for background tasks. Throughout the
lessons you'll see both how to write the code but also how to test it. Included
are lessons on good practices for code quality including using static analysis
tools for Python and JS and measuring test coverage.


Using This Repository
---------------------

This is all of the example code used during the video series. It does not include
the database files with the sample data. If you've purchased the videos then
this repo roughly equates to the "Working Files" provided with each video.

The various lessons are tagged in the repo and linked below. The chapters may
be rearranged from the order in which they are listed here in the final publication.
